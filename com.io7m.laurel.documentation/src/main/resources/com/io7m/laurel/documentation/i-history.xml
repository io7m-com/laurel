      The undo and redo stacks are stored in the <Link target="f9c3839f-9ec0-45e1-b5dd-dfb7a08b92af">file model</Link>.

    <Paragraph>
      Each command that is executed on the file model is <Term type="term">invertible</Term>. That is, each command
      knows how to perform an action, and how to revert that action. By storing the complete sequence of executed
      commands, it is effectively possible to take a dataset and repeatedly undo operations until the dataset is back at
      the blank starting state.
