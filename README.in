The `laurel` package attempts to provide tools to assist
with _image captioning_ within the context of [machine
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

In particular, the application is geared towards the management of smaller
datasets (in the range of thousands of images) for use in techniques such as
[LORA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning)#Low-rank_adaptation)
training.

## Features

* A user interface for managing images and captions for those images.
* A caption categorization system for assisting with keeping captions consistent across large datasets.
* The ability to import captions and images into a dataset from a directory hierarchy.
* The ability to export captions and images into a directory for use in training scripts.
* A persistent undo/redo system that can store every change ever made to a
  dataset, including the ability to effectively revert to an earlier version
  at any time.
* A carefully-engineered Java API for manipulating datasets; the command-line
  tools and user interface are thin shells over this API.
* Datasets are backed by [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) for reliable,
  transactional updates, and a file format that is designed to endure for
  decades to come.
* Command line tools for automating operations such as importing, exporting,
  and interrogating metadata.
* Comprehensive documentation.
* [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/)-ready.
* [JPMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)-ready.
* ISC license.
